To install OpenFEM you need to:

1/ Unzip the distribution to the target location of your choice <installdir>. 
Typically <installdir>=$MATLAB/toolbox, or if your are a SDT user, choose
<installdir>=$MATLAB/toolbox/sdt.
Unzip will create a subdirectory <installdir>/openfem.

2/ For UNIX user, notice that you usually need to become superuser
to have write permission in the $MATLAB subdirectories. You can easily 
circumvent this difficulty by unpacking the distribution in another 
directory where you have write permission. Note that you will need
a HTML browser to navigate within the documentation located 
in <installdir>/openfem/html.

3/ Include OpenFEM in your default path. For this, launch Matlab and 
change directories to <installdir>/openfem, then run the path check:

ofutil('path')
	
Then save your updated path for future Matlab sessions or include the above 
lines in your startup.m file, see matlabrc, (or have your system administrator 
modify your $MATLAB/toolbox/local/pathdef.m file).

4/ Move the openfem/html directory to $MATLAB/help/toolbox/openfem if you want 
it to be seen by MATLAB (cf. 2/).

5/ Compiling
For proper operation of OpenFEM, you should have three mex files (compiled 
dynamically linked libraries). of_mk is the gateway interface for 
FORTRAN routines of the OpenFEM library. sp_util groups C routines 
used for model assembly and associated functions. nopo2sd provides 
translation between the NOPO format of MODULEF and the OpenFEM format. 

You can compile these functions using the associated ofutil commands 
(help ofutil). Or the combined ofutil('mexall'). 

You are done ! 

You will find demos of OpenFEM capabilities in the openfem/demos and 
openfem/test directories.
